# UTPC-practice
Practice for UTPC (University of Texas Programming Competition)

This is personal training for competitive programming competitions. I'm practicing various algorithimic and problem-solving methods that will be grouped into folders. The ultimate goal is to make it onto the UTPC team and qualify for ICPC. Wish me luck.
